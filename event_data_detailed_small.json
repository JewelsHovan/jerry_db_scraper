They mostly played for fellow high-school audiences \u2013 sometimes they\u2019d play a rock song such as Raunchy.",

Now Swain's Music Store, where Pigpen was working, was run by a guy named Troy Weidenheimer who had ideas about forming his own rock'n'roll band. He of course knew Pigpen, Pigpen knew Garcia, Garcia knew Kreutzmann, and so \u2026 a short-lived band called the Zodiacs was formed. Troy played lead guitar, Pigpen was on harp. They used a wide selection of drummers but most of the time it was Bill Kreutzmann, and Garcia would sometimes join in on bass guitar when he wasn't involved with his own bluegrass groups.\""

        "from McNally's Long Strange Trip: They began their run backing up Cornell Gunther and the Coasters, and for the first set their rhythm guitarist was a guy named Terry, who taught them the songs. It was not really necessary for Garcia, who loved the Coasters and knew the material. Weir took the slight in seeming good humor, watching Terry so closely that he not only learned the chords but absorbed unconsciously how to cue a band with the neck of his guitar as a baton. From then on, when he sang a song, he became the bandleader, a democratic development not common to most bands. \"We knew Weir could cut it then,\" said Lesh. \"And after that it went much better, of course.\"",

        "We used to hold this as 12/10/65, but Ross Hannan helpfully suggests this event instead. Ross: the description from Darby Slick better suits the first Mime Troupe Benefit (Appeal 1) which was held on 19651106 (a Saturday) when the Calliope Warehouse Loft at 924 Howard Street, San Francisco hosted Jefferson Airplane, Fugs, Sandy Bull, John Handy Quintet, The Committee, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Jeanne Brechan, Jim Smith, Ullett & Hendra, The Family Dog, Sam Hanks, Mystery Trend, Peter Orlovsky, Allen Ginsberg. The performers listed on the handbill concludes with '& Others Who Care'. Perhaps the local folk-rock crowd cared? The Mystery Trend played without prior announcement. The loft was rented by the SF Mime Troupe at the time. The price of admission was what you could afford to pay. In an interview in the SF Examiner (19820207) Paul Kantner notes of this show: 'Benefits arose out of natural needs in the area \u2026 if one of your friends got busted, for instance. One of the first benefits the Airplane did was for the SF Mime Troupe, down around Mission or Howard in a loft actually Calliope Warehouse which got so crowded, the people spilled out in to the streets.'\"",

The Acid Test, from 8 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. March 19 in The Student Union Grand Ballroom. What is The Acid Test? Well, it is a sort of a happening, a very total happening. There is no audience, no group of performers; everyone comes and the thing happens. There is music \u2014 The Grateful Dead will play genuine rock-'n-roll for dancing. But anyone can play music \u2014 there will be mikes and amplifiers available \u2014 and any person or group is urged to bring their equipment. There will be movies, three or four at a time, of the Pranksters and others doing whatever they do. But anyone can bring their own films and/or equipment. There will be people in strange clothes; come as you will. There will be strange lights, strobes and color wheels; bring more if need be. There will be Neal Cassady of On The Road doing battle with the fabled Thunder Machine, Roy's Audioptics, the Electric Man, the Psychedelic Symphonette, assorted miracles and marvels, more noise and yet more music. Tickets ($1.50 for students) are on sale at the Kerckhoff Hall Ticket Office or can be purchased at the door.\" Google Daily Bruin Print Archive. The preview thus gives billing as Neal Cassady / Thunder Machine / Roy's Audioptics / The Electric Man / Psychedelic Symphonette. The ad bills GD / Tiny Tim / Merry Pranksters / Paul Butterfield / movies / stroboscopic lights / Electric Kool-Aid. I usually follow the lex posteriori rule of construction, but I'll concatenate them because, really, it's an Acid Test, and who really knows?

The University of California at San Francisco, primarily a medical school located very near the Haight-Ashbury, seems to have hosted a conference on the medical benefits of LSD research from June 13-18. Apparently, there was a party at a Marin mansion with a swimming pool, and the Grateful Dead performed. Memories seem foggy.\"",

The exact venue of these performances has been the subject of debate since we changed their location. Yes, they were scheduled for Winterland (which, contrary to Terry Doherty's statement in the Internet Archive, did exist as a concert venue by this time) as listed on the poster, but Ralph Gleason's column in the San Francisco Chronicle the morning of October 7 mentioned these shows as taking place at the Fillmore. On the same page, the Chronicle's \"Datebook\" lists this billing as \"opening today\" at Fillmore Auditorium and specifically states that the shows were \"switched from Winterland.\" The week before, Bill Graham had moved the Butterfield, Airplane, Muddy Waters shows at Winterland to the Fillmore to prove that he wouldn't back down to racial unrest in the surrounding neighborhood.",

The Loading Zone did perform.\" LIA quotes Stanford Daily: \"Students at UC Berkeley are planning a vigil today to coincide with a meeting on the Berkeley campus of the California Board of Regents. The vigil is scheduled to begin at about 9:30 this morning across the street from University Hall, where the Regents are expected to discuss Governor Ronald Reagan\u2019s proposals to cut the University\u2019s budget and charge tuition. Two rock and roll bands, the Grateful Dead and the Loading Zone, have volunteered to entertain the vigilers while the Regents are meeting. The Berkeley Police Department has given unofficial notice that the bands and the vigilers will not be interfered with so long as order is maintained.\"",

Towards the end of Dark Star Pigpen(?) says \"It drags. It drags right there\". There is no banjo at the end either, but there is an acoustic guitar heard towards the beginning."

Hannan: \"There is plenty of evidence supporting the February 15 date: (a) a mention at the end of the February 14 Valentine\u2019s Day show at the Carousel that both bands would be playing for free outside San Quentin the following afternoon; (b) contemporary reports regarding the performances (c) photographs of the performers; (d) memories of a number of the performers; (e) and not least, Country Joe and The Fish were in New York on March 7. On the basis of this evidence, I am very confident that the March 7 date is incorrect and the February 15 is correct.\" Membership is unclear. Arnold, 1: \"The February 16, 1968 article identifies the Grateful Dead, but I think it may not have been all of them. Don't we have an account from Jef Jaisun (Phoenix bassist)? I think it was an ongoing jam session with various players cycling in and out, and I think Jerry Garcia and Jack Casady were both there.\" Dister says Phil was absent, and Bob Weir played bass!\"",

An eyewitness on deadlists says, \"The night before, 5/4/68 at the Fillmore East, Paul Kantner told the audience that they will be playing free in the park with the Dead tomorrow. The Dead opened 5/5/68 with Bob Weir saying to the NYC crowd, 'Welcome to San Francisco.'\" Although he remembers the Dead opening and the Airplane playing next, the Village Voice article from May 16 said that Butterfield and the Airplane went first, and the Dead closed, and apparently had to cut their set short because they weren't permitted to play longer in the park. I'm reminded of the September 16, 1967 free concert in Griffith Park in Los Angeles - the two bands were in town, had the day free, and decided what the heck, let's have a free afternoon show in a park... (Though they'd both played the night before, both on 9/15/67 and 5/4/68!)",

Throughout the ballroom an outstanding feature was the peacefulness and the joy as a wondrous assortment of people relaxed. There were Hells Angels and hippies, many black people and many men long-hair youth [sic]. It seemed for a moment like the hope of the future. And then I went outside, got into the car and punched the radio button only to hear a voice saying 'When Senator Kennedy was shot tonight ...' and the terrible real world came crashing in on me again.\" At the end of the next night, a \"man slowly died, and this terrible feeling came on again, the feeling of doom I had lost in the Carousel the night before, and the country seemed fated to keep spinning out of control down some grim spiral to madness.\" Wow.",

These dates fell on Friday, Saturday, Sunday in 1968 which looks more likely so I think that is the correct year. The Dead were at the Carousel that weekend so the shows did not happen. Or maybe the poster (and Jerry and Bob's autographs on it) is just a fake.\" (LIA)"

        "Corry 2016: \"The Ali Akbar College Of Music was established in Oakland in 1967. Mickey Hart started studying at the school with tabla master Shankar Gosh in 1968, taking what he learned in the school back to Bill Kreutzmann and hence to the Grateful Dead. The College was based in a house in the Oakland hills, at 6024 Ascot Drive. The school outgrew the house however, and thanks to the timely intervention of Rhoney Stanley, the lease was taken over by Owsley Stanley, and the house passed into Grateful Dead legend. At different times, Owsley and Rhoney's roommates included Bob Weir, Bob Thomas, Bob Matthews, Ramrod and Betty Cantor. In return for letting Owsley and Rhoney take over the lease on 6024 Ascot, Alla Rakha got Rhoney to arrange for his drumming students, including Mickey, to take part in a Grateful Dead concert. True to her word, Rhoney arranged for a special drumming session at the Berkeley Community Theater on September 20, 1968, when Gosh and Vince Delgado joined Mickey and Bill for some high-end percussion.\"",
        "deadsources: September 20, 1968: Berkeley Community Theater",
        "Rhoney narrates some of this: the Ali Akbar Khan School of Music, was \"situated in a beautiful Spanish-style multilevel house with arts-and-crafts detailing in the secluded hills of Oakland, southeast of Berkeley.\" Just up from the Claremont, and Bear moved in there. The 9/20/68 opening for Vince Delgado, administrative director of the School, was the price paid to get the house: \"If Vince could realize his dream, he would turn over the lease to Bear. Nobody else would get a shot at the house.\"",

We were to open and Mint Tattoo was to also be featured. We had one set of material with Jimmy Hibbs doing most of the vocals and rhythm guitar, Jim Knight on Bass, Ron Leach on drums, and Marshall Adams on lead guitar and folk flute. Well we opened and it went quite well. 35 minutes later we went back on and did our set again.

I know Pig was wailing out front and learned since that it was Tom's first night on keys, which freed Pig for vocal theatrics. Oh did the boys play...long into the evening!\" Another witness confirms the small crowd: \"Sort of catch-as-catch-can atmosphere, big venue, but small audience (heck Thanksgiving was here!), as in Columbus the night before. Small turnout for two nights in a row made me wonder if this band had a future! Again, general weirdness and jamming prevailed.\"",

At one point a member of the SDS came on stage, giving a big anti-war speech. No one seemed to care, since everyone there was grooving on the Dead. At points, very informal, many folks on stage, some part of the Dead family, others just hanging and dancing. As Athens was a very rural area, a bunch of us retreated to a Hippie farmhouse after the show (maybe 2 AM) and continued to groove on with the Dead. A good time had by all. Special time because no one was famous yet.\"",

Thanks to Lee Cohn for pointing this out. On the theme, the last tune here starts off as Pickett's \"Funky Broadway\" and then turns into what we list here. But this is not a known or credited song as far as we have been able to find. The \"title\" phrase appears in \"Mojo Hannah\" done by Little Esther Phillips, definitely in that same Stax vein as the Pickett tunes. We currently imagine this is just an improvised set of lyrics, but are of course open to being set straight! Elvin Bishop has long been said to appear on guitar, and Jim Powell confirms three guitars at, e.g., ca. 16:40 and elsewhere during the first jam here.",
